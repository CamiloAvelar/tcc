@article{Kodali2017,
	abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 IEEE.By the virtue of blooming automation industry and wireless connectivity, all the devices within the home can be connected. This improves the comfort, energy efficiency, indoor security, cost savings of the home. Small and constrained embedded devices are used to remotely monitor the conditions within home and control the home appliances. In such case, power consumption and network bandwidth become a major concern. We need a low power device that transmits messages through a less verbose protocol. Owing to the ubiquitous availability of WiFi, all the appliances within home can be connected through a common gateway. This paper presents an overview of a light weight Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol. In the prototype, we attempt to implement MQTT on ESP8266, a WiFi based development board. Sensors and actuators are connected to ESP8266 and a Mosquitto based MQTT broker is established for remote monitoring and control.},

@book{Pahl,
	abstract = {Microservices have recently emerged as an architectural style, addressing how to build, manage, and evolve architectures out of small, self-contained units. Particularly in the cloud, the microservices architecture approach seems to be an ideal complementation of container technology at the PaaS level However, there is currently no secondary study to consolidate this research. We aim here to identify, taxonomically classify and systematically compare the existing research body on microservices and their application in the cloud. We have conducted a systematic mapping study of 21 selected studies, published over the last two years until end of 2015 since the emergence of the microservices pattern. We classified and compared the selected studies based on a characterization framework. This results in a discussion of the agreed and emerging concerns within the microservices architectural style, positioning it within a continuous development context, but also moving it closer to cloud and container technology.},

Among all container solutions, Docker is currently leading the market. In particular, Docker is a complete packaging and software delivery tool. In this work, we first provide a comprehensive view on containers ecosystem; later, we discuss through realistic use-cases the security implications of Docker environment. Further, we define an adversary model, point out several vulnerabilities affecting current usages of Docker, and finally we discuss further research directions.},

In recent times, there were huge needs of consumer based humanitarian projects that could be rapidly developed using Internet of Things (IoT) technology. In this paper, we propose an IoT based water monitoring system that measures water level in real-time. Our prototype is based on idea that the level of the water can be very important parameter when it comes to the flood occurrences especially in disaster prone areas. A water level sensor is used to detect the desired parameter, and if the water level reaches the parameter, the signal will be feed in realtime to social network like Twitter. A cloud server was configured as data repository. The measurement of the water levels are displayed in remote dashboard.},

Relying on a comprehensive literature review, this paper aims to contribute towards narrowing the gap between the existing state-of-the-art smart home applications and the prospect of their integration into an IoT enabled environment. We propose a holistic framework which incorporates different components from IoT architectures/frameworks proposed in the literature, in order to efficiently integrate smart home objects in a cloud-centric IoT based solution. We identify a smart home management model for the proposed framework and the main tasks that should be performed at each level. We additionally discuss practical design challenges with emphasis on data processing, as well as smart home communication protocols and their interoperability. We believe that the holistic framework ascertained in this paper can be used as a solid base for the future developers of Internet of Things based smart home solutions.},
